# Python - Test-driven development

This repository contains Python scripts that implement various functions using test-driven development (TDD) principles. The project aims to reinforce the concepts of TDD, documentation, and unit testing in Python programming.

## Concepts

The project focuses on the following concepts:

- Writing test cases before writing code
- Creating unit tests using the `unittest` module
- Writing documentation (docstrings) for modules and functions
- Handling different data types and edge cases in tests
- Understanding the importance of tests and their role in software development

## Requirements

- All Python scripts should be written using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- The scripts should have executable permissions and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- The code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.8.*).
- The project should include a `README.md` file at the root of the folder.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `0-add_integer.py`: Implements a function to add two integers.
- `tests/0-add_integer.txt`: Contains test cases for the `add_integer` function.
- `2-matrix_divided.py`: Implements a function to divide all elements of a matrix.
- `tests/2-matrix_divided.txt`: Contains test cases for the `matrix_divided` function.
- `3-say_my_name.py`: Implements a function to print a person's name.
- `tests/3-say_my_name.txt`: Contains test cases for the `say_my_name` function.
- `4-print_square.py`: Implements a function to print a square using `#` characters.
- `tests/4-print_square.txt`: Contains test cases for the `print_square` function.
- `5-text_indentation.py`: Implements a function to print text with indentation.
- `tests/5-text_indentation.txt`: Contains test cases for the `text_indentation` function.
- `6-max_integer.py`: Implements a function to find the maximum integer in a list.
- `tests/6-max_integer_test.py`: Contains unittests for the `max_integer` function.
