# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Project


Welcome to the Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) project. In this project, you will learn about connecting Python to a MySQL database, performing various database operations, and working with SQLAlchemy, a popular Python ORM library.

## Background

In this project, you will explore the world of databases and Python by completing a series of tasks related to object-relational mapping. You will use MySQL as your database system and SQLAlchemy as the ORM tool. The tasks include:

- [x] Connecting to a MySQL database using Python
- [x] Performing SELECT and INSERT operations on a MySQL table
- [x] Using SQLAlchemy to create a Python class mapped to a MySQL table
- [x] Querying and manipulating data using SQLAlchemy
- [x] Handling SQL injection safely
- [x] Creating and managing database models
- [x] And more!

## Requirements

### General
- Supported Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python ORM. Here are some of the key tasks:

1. **Get all states**: Write a script to list all states from the database.

2. **Filter states**: List all states with names starting with 'N'.

3. **Filter states by user input**: Create a script to search for states based on user input.

4. **SQL Injection**: Implement a script that is safe from SQL injection.

5. **Cities by states**: List all cities from the database.

6. **All cities by state**: Show all cities of a given state.

7. **First state model**: Create a Python class definition for the State model.

8. **All states via SQLAlchemy**: List all State objects using SQLAlchemy.

9. **Contains 'a'**: List all State objects containing the letter 'a'.

10. **Get a state**: Retrieve the State object with a specific name.

11. **Add a new state**: Insert a new State object into the database.

12. **Update a state**: Change the name of a State object.

13. **Delete states**: Delete State objects with names containing the letter 'a'.

14. **Cities in state**: Create a City model and fetch City objects by state.
