## Description
This project is part of the second chance program and focuses on Python Network concepts. It includes a series of tasks that cover various aspects of network programming, including sending HTTP requests, handling HTTP methods, working with cURL, and more.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of HTTP, URLs, and cookies.
- Perform HTTP requests using cURL.
- Write Bash and Python scripts for network-related tasks.
- Handle HTTP methods and headers.
- Gain insights into how web browsers work at the application level.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Bash scripts must be exactly 3 lines long
- Python scripts must adhere to PEP8 guidelines
- Proper documentation for modules, classes, and functions is mandatory
- All curl commands must use the `-s` (silent mode) option
- Compatibility with Python 3.8.5 and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Detailed documentation for scripts, modules, classes, and functions
- No plagiarism is allowed

## Tasks
The project includes the following tasks:

1. [cURL body size](./0-body_size.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to display the size of the body of an HTTP response.
   
2. [cURL to the end](./1-body.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to display the body of an HTTP response with a 200 status code.

3. [cURL Method](./2-delete.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to send a DELETE request and display the response body.

4. [cURL only methods](./3-methods.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to display the HTTP methods accepted by a server.

5. [cURL headers](./4-header.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to send an HTTP GET request with a custom header and display the response body.

6. [cURL POST parameters](./5-post_params.sh)
   - Write a Bash script to send an HTTP POST request with parameters and display the response body.

7. [Find a peak](./6-peak.py)
   - Write a Python function to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers. The algorithm must have the lowest complexity.

## Usage
To use any of the scripts or complete the tasks, follow the instructions provided in each task's description.
