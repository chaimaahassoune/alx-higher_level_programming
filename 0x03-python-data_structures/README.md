# Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the usage of lists and tuples in Python programming. It also includes solutions to various tasks related to these data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Understand what lists are and how to use them
- Identify the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Utilize common methods of lists
- Implement lists as stacks and queues
- Apply list comprehensions in Python
- Understand tuples and their usage
- Determine when to use tuples versus lists
- Define a sequence and perform tuple packing and sequence unpacking
- Use the `del` statement effectively

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all the integers of a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: A Python script that retrieves an element from a list.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A Python script that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all the integers of a list in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A Python script that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
- `5-no_c.py`: A Python script that removes all occurrences of the character 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A Python script that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: A Python script that adds two tuples.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: A Python script that returns the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: A Python script that finds the biggest integer in a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A Python script that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

## Requirements and Usage

- All Python scripts are written in Python 3.8.5 and are compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Each script can be executed independently.
- The scripts do not require any external modules.
- All scripts should be made executable using the command `chmod +x <filename.py>`.
- The scripts should be run with the command `./<filename.py>`.
