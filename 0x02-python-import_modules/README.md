# 0x02-python-import_modules

This repository contains Python scripts created as part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum. The scripts demonstrate various concepts related to importing modules in Python.

## Files

* [0-add.py](./0-add.py): Program that imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition.
* [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py): Program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs mathematical operations.
* [2-args.py](./2-args.py): Program that prints the number of and the list of its command line arguments.
* [3-infinite_add.py](./3-infinite_add.py): Program that prints the result of the addition of all command line arguments.
* [4-hidden_discovery.py](./4-hidden_discovery.py): Program that prints the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
* [5-variable_load.py](./5-variable_load.py): Program that imports the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8.x
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Pycodestyle 2.8.*

## Usage

You can run the Python scripts directly from the command line. For example:

* `./0-add.py`
* `./1-calculation.py`
* `./2-args.py`
* `./3-infinite_add.py`
* `./4-hidden_discovery.py`
* `./5-variable_load.py`

Each script demonstrates a specific concept related to importing modules in Python.
