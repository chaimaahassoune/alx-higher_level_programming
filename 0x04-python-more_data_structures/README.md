# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This project focuses on learning about sets and dictionaries in Python and their various operations. It consists of several tasks that cover different aspects of working with these data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome
- Understand sets and how to use them
- Apply common methods of sets and understand their usage
- Determine when to use sets versus lists
- Iterate over a set
- Understand dictionaries and their usage
- Compare dictionaries with lists or sets and choose appropriate data structures
- Comprehend the concept of keys in a dictionary
- Iterate over a dictionary
- Understand lambda functions
- Use the map, reduce, and filter functions

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

1. `0-square_matrix_simple.py`: A function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix.
2. `1-search_replace.py`: A function that replaces all occurrences of an element with another element in a list.
3. `2-uniq_add.py`: A function that adds all unique integers in a list, considering each integer only once.
4. `3-common_elements.py`: A function that returns a set of common elements between two sets.
5. `4-only_diff_elements.py`: A function that returns a set of elements that are present in only one of the two sets.
6. `5-number_keys.py`: A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
7. `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`: A function that prints a dictionary with its keys in alphabetical order.
8. `7-update_dictionary.py`: A function that updates a dictionary by replacing or adding key-value pairs.
9. `8-simple_delete.py`: A function that deletes a key from a dictionary.
10. `9-multiply_by_2.py`: A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
11. `10-best_score.py`: A function that returns the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.

## Requirements and Execution

- All the files are written in Python 3.8.5 and should be executed using an interpreter with Python 3.8.5 or higher.
- All files should be executable.
- The PEP 8 style guidelines should be followed, and the code should pass the pycodestyle linter (version 2.8.*).
- Each file contains a main function that demonstrates the usage of the implemented functions.

## Usage

To test the functions, you can run the individual files using the Python interpreter
